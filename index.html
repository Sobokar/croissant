    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is typically made of yeast-risen dough. The dough is first
      layered with butter and then rolled. It is folded many times in a process
      called lamination. Then the dough is cut into triangles, rolled to form a
      crescent shape and baked.
